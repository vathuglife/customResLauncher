# Welcome to Custom Resolution Launcher!
## Introduction
This is a simple desktop app that changes the screen resolution, then launches a selected game.

## Technologies used
Kivy (a Python framework)

## Motivation
On computers with integrated graphics (or low-end graphics capabilities), lowering the system 
resolution is one of the best ways to improve the overall performance. So, instead of manually changing 
the system resolution manually before launching the game, this app can automate that process.

## Project/Build Status
1.0 (Deprecated)

## Code Style
Single-file
